# 🔗 BTC Relay App

**BTC Relay App** is an all-in-one web + mobile solution developed for the Bitnob hackathon. It enables vendors to receive Bitcoin over the Lightning Network and instantly convert it to Uganda Shillings (UGX) via Bitnob's API. Shoppers pay using Lightning; vendors get local currency.
